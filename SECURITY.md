## How to Report Security Exploits 

Rifthook recognizes the importance of security exploits. If you have found a security exploit/vulnerability, please contact property#9949 on Discord.
Successful security bugs will be eligable for a bounty reward. By reporting an exploit, you agree that you will not discuss the exploit until it has been properly fixed.

Note: Due to logistical reasons, we will only be able to give you the bug bounty via Steam or Robux (We will use the official Robux conversion rate)

## Platforms available for bug bounty

## Retesting

We may request retesting of an exploit to ensure the fix is properly working. If you retest an exploit within 86 hours, we will compensate you with €5 - €7.
