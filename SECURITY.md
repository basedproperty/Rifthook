## Reporting a Vulnerability

Plese report any vulnerability that could cause the Rifthook script to be leaked/cracked immediately (for a big reward!). You can also report a minor bug for a small reward.
Note that the vulnerability must be an actual vulnerability, or it will be declined. 

To report any vulnerabilities, DM me on Discord (property#9949).
